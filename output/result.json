The first factor is the node’s degree; a higher number of  adjacent nodes suggests an increased capacity for direct influence, thus enhancing the overall effect of the node.  The second factor involves the distance between nodes, as the strength of influence decreases in proportion to the  square of the distance-nodes that are clo",

Zhang et al.: Identification of Key Nodes in Complex Networks straightforward and extensively employed, their drawback lies in their partial utilization of the intricate structural traits of the network. In the pursuit of more effectively identifying the most influential key nodes, machine learning-based algorithms for key node identification are emerging as promising tools. These approaches can be categorized as either supervised or unsupervised methods. The supervised method generally invol",
